- Organized object-oriented design (classes for player, enemies, etc.)  
- Uses Java Swing for graphics  
## How games function: 
I have made a Menus with a settings to reduce volume and instructions of how to play the game
Start the game : There is a requirement at each level , a sign table appear as you start the every new level it tells you what you need in order to open the door
If player collide with monster , player will lose their heart , collect healing portion on the road to get back heart if heart < 0 , die =true , player = die , restart the game 
i also have player to attack the last boss , when the boss get defeated the key drops 
There is also time limit count down , if time reach 0, you will restart the level
