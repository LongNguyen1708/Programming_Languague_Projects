\# üîê Password Strength \& Hashing Tool



This project is a \*\*password auditing and hashing tool\*\* built in Python.  

It checks whether a password is strong, verifies if it is a common password (e.g., from \*\*RockYou.txt\*\*), and demonstrates how to securely hash and verify passwords using \*\*SHA-1\*\* and \*\*SHA-256\*\*.

&nbsp;Features



\-  Detects if a password is in a common password list (RockYou.txt or fallback list).  

\-  Evaluates password strength based on:

&nbsp; - Uppercase letters  

&nbsp; - Lowercase letters  

&nbsp; - Digits  

&nbsp; - Symbols  

&nbsp; - Length (12+ chars)  

&nbsp; - No identical consecutive characters  

\-  Returns a score out of 6 with detailed feedback on weaknesses.  

\-  Hashing demo:

&nbsp; - Hash passwords with \*\*SHA-1\*\* or \*\*SHA-256\*\*  

&nbsp; - Verify passwords against stored hashes
